actually the best way is to let `discovery` do the work, define one peer and a channel then call discovery on the channel, giving you all the peers on the channel.
```
const channel = client.newChanel('mychannel');
const peer = client.newPeer(peerUrl, opts);
channel.initialize({discovery:true, target: peer});
const peers = channel.getPeers();
